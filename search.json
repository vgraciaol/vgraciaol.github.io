    "text": "Takeaways\n\nA list of arguments is not always required for a function to be executed.\nA function that does not have a return element technically returns nothing; but it implicitly returns the last line of code.\nA function can have multiple return elements, however, once it encounters a return, it exits.\nEllipsis allows you to pass additional arguments without having to first define them in the argument list, and these arguments can then be passed to another function call within the body of the code."
