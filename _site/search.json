Padula, “Introduction to Markov modeling”, in David Bishai, Logan Brenzel, and William Padula (eds), Handbook of Applied Health Economics in Vaccines, Handbooks in Health Economic Evaluation (Oxford, 2023; online edn, Oxford Academic, 20 Apr. 2023), https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780192896087.003.0022, accessed 10 Sept. 2024.\n\nIntroduction\n\nModels can be a valuable tool for public health decision-making. They help to extrapolate the long-term effects of observed clinical trials and estimate the distribution of a population into different health states when implementing policy strategies.\nHealth (e.g., life years, quality of life) and economic (e.g., vaccination costs) outcomes can be estimated for each strategy considered.\nMarkov models depict how individuals move between health states based on their previous state probabilities.\nMarkov assumption: all states are independent of all pasts states.\n\n\n\nElements\n\nSet of health states that are mutually exclusive (an individual cannot be in both states simultaneously) and exhaustive (includes all possible states).\nTransition matrix that represents the transition of individuals in a cohort between different health states (constant or time-varying).\n\n\\[\nT =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nq(s_1,s_1) & q(s_1,s_2) & q(s_1,s_3) \\\\\nq(s_2,s_1) & q(s_2,s_2) & q(s_2,s_3)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\\(q(s_i,s_j)\\) describes the transition probability from the current state \\(s_i\\) to the transition state \\(s_j\\).\nThe value of each transition probability ranges between 0 and 1.\nEach row must sum to 1, as all the states are mutually exclusive.\n\n\nTransitions occur over a period, called cycle \\(t\\).\nThe probability of being in a state \\(S(t)\\) can be denoted as:\n\n\\[\nS(t) = S(0)\\times T^t\n\\]\nwhere, \\(S(0)\\) is the vector of the probabilities of being in each state at the beginning of the simulation, \\(T^t\\) is the product of multiplying \\(t\\) state transition matrices.\n\nSet of rewards or payoffs (e.g., cost of benefits) associated to each state.\nIf an individual is unable to leave a state once they enter it (e.g., dead), that state is considered to be an absorbing state, and any non-absorbing state is called transient.\n\n\n\nExample: hepatitis B\n\nFive mutually exclusive health states: susceptible (S), infected (I), vaccinated (V), recovered (R), and dead (D).\n\n\n\n\nState transition diagram\n\n\n\nCycle length 1 year.\nTime horizon 59 years (lifetime horizon).\nModel inputs usually come from published data, clinical trials (e.g., vaccine efficacy), transition probabilities from life tables, expert panels, among others.\n\nThe proportion of susceptible people getting vaccinated each cycle is 0.10.\n70% of susceptible people become infected each year.\n0.0045% of the vaccinated individuals lose protection from the vaccine.\n7 out of 8 people with hepatitis C recover.\nThe probability of death is 0.002 for susceptible, vaccinated, and recovered individuals, and 0.006 for infected individuals.\nSusceptible cohort population aged 20 years.\n\n\n\nSteps into developing a model in R\n\nParameterization of the model. We will create a function that takes the model inputs as arguments and returns a list containing all the model parameters.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nMarkov model function: Now that we have a function that collects all the model inputs into a list, let’s create a function that takes the model parameters and returns the distribution of health states at each step.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nSimulation: We run the Markov model with the specific model inputs.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlot outcomes of interest\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page."
