# R basics

The following sections use several coding examples and follow the same structure as @Davis2016.

## Matrices and arrays

A **matrix** is a powerful tool, featuring a rectangular arrangement of numbers, symbols, or expressions in rows and columns. For example,

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
7 & 3 \\
4 & 9
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$A$ is a matrix with 3 rows and 2 columns, usually said to be a $3 \times 2$ matrix.

Matrices are useful for organizing (numeric) data based on individuals (rows) and attributes (columns). For instance, imagine you have the age, sex, and years of schooling for three people:

```{r}
#| echo: false

df <- data.frame(Ind = 1:3,
                 Age  = c(48,34,56),
                 Male = c(1,0,1),
                 Sch_yr = c(10,9,12))
           

knitr::kable(df, format = "html", 
             col.names = c("Ind","Age","Male","Years of schooling"),
             align = c("c","c","c"))
```

This information can then be represented by a $3 \times 3$ matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
48 & 1 & 10 \\
34 & 0 & 9 \\
56 & 1 & 12
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Matrix

The `matrix()` function in `R` has the following arguments:

-   `data` in a form of a vector,

-   `nrow` number of rows,

-   `ncol` number of columns,

-   `byrow` (logical) default is `FALSE` meaning that the matrix is filled by columns,

-   `dimnames` a list of two elements containing the row and column names, respectively.

**Example 1**

Let's create a $2 \times 2$ matrix:

```{webr-r}
# Create a 2x2 matrix
m_A <- matrix(data = c(-3, 2, 83, 0.15), 
              nrow = 2,
              ncol = 2)

# Get matrix
m_A
```

Note how `R` filled the matrix column-by-column since by default `byrow = FALSE`.

**Example 2**

What happens if you don't specify the `nrow` and `ncol` arguments?

```{webr-r}
# Create a matrix without specifying 
# ncol and nrow
m_A <- matrix(data = c(-3, 2, 83, 0.15, 7))

# Get matrix
m_A
```

If `nrow` and `ncol` are not specified default is a single-column matrix.

**Example 3**

Let's change the `byrow` argument to `TRUE`.

```{webr-r}
# 2x2 matrix, byrow = TRUE
m_A <- matrix(data  = c(-3, 2, 83, 0.15), 
              nrow  = 2,
              ncol  = 2,
              byrow = TRUE)

# Get matrix
m_A
```

Note that the matrix's first row was filled out before moving on to the next one.

**Example 4**

Let's create a $2 \times 3$ matrix whose row and column names are indicated using `dimnames`.

```{webr-r}
# 2x3 matrix, filled by row 
# indicating row and column names
m_C <- matrix(data  = 4:9,
              nrow  = 2,
              ncol  = 3,
              byrow = TRUE,
              dimnames = 
                list(
                # vector of row names
                c("r1","r2"),
                # vector of column names
                c("c1","c2","c3"))
              )

# Get matrix
m_C
```

Note that `dimnames` must be specified using a `list`.

**Example 5**

What if you don't have enough data to fill the matrix?

```{webr-r}
# 2x3 matrix
m_D <- matrix(
  # 4 data points to fill a 2x3 matrix
  data  = 1:4,
  nrow  = 2,
  ncol  = 3
  )

# Get matrix
m_D
```

If there is insufficient data to fill a matrix as specified by the user, the values will be **recycled**. This is important to note as it will not give an error, but a warning, and the matrix can still be used in other operations.

**Sub-setting**

We can subset values from a matrix by indicating `matrix_name[row,column]`.

-   If the matrix rows and columns have names the names can be used to subset.

-   If you leave the row (column) value blank, it will extract the entire column (row).

*Example*

```{webr-r}
# 2x3 matrix
m_C <- matrix(data  = 4:9,
              nrow  = 2,
              ncol  = 3,
              byrow = TRUE,
              dimnames = 
                list(
                # vector of row names
                c("r1","r2"),
                # vector of column names
                c("c1","c2","c3"))
              )

# Get matrix
m_C

# Subset
m_C[2,2]         # second row, second column
m_C[1,]          # first row, all columns
m_C[,3]          # third column, all rows
m_C["r2","c3"]   # second row, third column
```

**Operations with matrices**

-   `t()` transpose of a matrix: switching a matrix's rows and columns.

    ```{webr-r}
    # 2x5 matrix
    m_D <- matrix(data  = 1:10,
                  nrow  = 2,
                  ncol  = 5)

    # Subset a matrix from m_D
    # All rows, second, third, and fourth colum
    # 2x3 matrix
    m_D[,2:4]                          

    # Transpose 3x2 matrix
    t(m_D[,2:4])
    ```

-   `diag()` extract or replace the diagonal of a matrix, or construct a diagonal matrix. **NOTE**: Remember that you can always use `?diag` to get documentation about the function and its uses.

    ```{webr-r}
    # Construct a 2x2 identity matrix
    m_I <- diag(nrow = 2)
    m_I

    # Get the diagonal of a matrix
    m_A <- matrix(data = c(-3, 2, 83, 0.15), 
                  nrow = 2,
                  ncol = 2)
    m_A
    diag(m_A)

    # Replace the diagonal of a matrix
    diag(m_I) <- c(3,90)
    m_I

    # Construct a diagonal matrix
    diag(x = c(2,3,4), nrow = 3)
    ```

-   Equally sized matrices can be added and subtracted.

    ```{webr-r}
    # 2x2 diagonal matrix
    m_E <- diag(x = c(2,-8), nrow = 2)
    m_E

    # 2x2 matrix
    m_F <- matrix(data = seq(5, 20, by = 5), 
                  nrow = 2,
                  ncol = 2)
    m_F

    # 4x1 matrix
    m_G <- matrix(c(24,9,0,4))
    m_G

    # Operations 
    m_E + m_F
    m_F - m_F
    m_E + m_G         # error
    ```

-   Matrix multiplication `%*%`: `ncol` and `nrow` can be useful functions that check if two matrices can be multiplied.

    ```{webr-r}
    m_A <- matrix(data = c(-3, 2, 83, 0.15))
    t(m_A)     # transpose
    m_A

    # Check that t(m_A) has the same 
    # number of columns as m_A has rows
    ncol(t(m_A)) == nrow(m_A)

    # Matrix multiplication
    t(m_A)%*%m_A
    ```

-   `solve()` returns the inverse of a **square matrix.**

    ```{webr-r}
    # 2x2 matrix
    m_A <- matrix(data = c(-3, 2, 83, 0.15), 
                  nrow = 2,
                  ncol = 2)

    solve(m_A)
    ```

### Arrays

Matrices are a special kind of two-dimensional arrays. If you want to create objects with more dimensions, `array()` is a useful function.

**Example 1**

An array with 3 rows, 4 columns and 2 layers, filled column-wise.

```{webr-r}
a_AR <- array(data = 1:24,
              dim  = c(3,4,2)) 

# Get array
a_AR
```

**Example 2**

Adding another layer.

```{webr-r}
a_BR <- array(data = rep(x     = 1:24, 
                         times = 3),
              dim  = c(3,4,2,3))

# Get array
a_BR
```

**Sub-setting**

```{webr-r}
a_BR <- array(data = rep(x     = 1:24, 
                         times = 3),
              dim  = c(3,4,2,3))

a_BR

# Get the 3rd row, 4th column of the first element of the 
# first layer, of the third element of the second layer
a_BR[3,4,1,3]
```

## Conditionals and loops

### `if-else` statement

An If-else statement requires a condition that returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

*Basic structure:*

```{webr-r}
# if(condition){
#   do any code in here if condition is TRUE
# } else {
#   do any code in here if condition is FALSE
# }
```

**Example 1**

Let's evaluate a number. If the number is 4, then let's square it; otherwise, let's return the same number.

```{webr-r}
# Number
a <- 4

# if-else
if(a == 4){
  # \n creates an new line
  cat("The condition was", a == 4,"\n")
  a <- a^2
}else{
  # \n creates an new line
  cat("The condition was", a != 4,"\n")
  a <- a
}

# Get value of a
a
```

**Example 2**

`If-else` only works for conditions of `length = 1`.

```{webr-r}
# Number
a <- 4

# if-else: error
if (c(T,T,F,F,T)){  
  a <- 3
}else{
  a <- 5
}
```

**Example 3**

You can use nested `if-else` if you want to evaluate more than one statement.

```{webr-r}
# Example: you have the age of four 
# individuals and you want to get it using 
# a series of if-else statements

# String
str1 <- "Ava"

# Nested if-else
if(str1 == "Omar"){
  cal <- 37
  cat(paste0(str1,"'s age is ", cal, "."))
}else if(str1 == "Alexander"){
  cal <- 19
  cat(paste0(str1,"'s age is ", cal, "."))
}else if(str1 == "Ava"){
  cal <- 21
  cat(paste0(str1,"'s age is ", cal, "."))
}else if(str1 == "Vanessa"){
  cal <- 30
  cat(paste0(str1,"'s age is ", cal, "."))
}else{
  cal <- NA
  cat("That individual does not exist.")
}
```

**Example 4**

The `switch` function allows to evaluate an expression (`EXPR`) and choose from a list of alternatives. The following code is similar to **Example 3**.

```{webr-r}
# String
str1 <- "Ava"

# switch() function
cal <- switch(EXPR      = str1,
              Omar      = 37,
              Alexander = 19,
              Ava       = 21,
              Vanessa   = 30,
              NA)             # unnamed element in case of no match

# Result
if(!is.na(cal)){
  cat(paste0(str1,"'s age is ", cal, "."))
}else{
  cat("That individual does not exist.")
}
```

**Example 5**

Use the `ifelse(test, yes, no)` function to test an expression and return the elements in `yes` or `no`, depending on whether the test is `TRUE` or `FALSE`. The following code is similar to **Example 1**. This can be useful when managing data.

```{webr-r}
# If the number is 4, then let's square it; 
# otherwise, let's return the same number.

# Number
a <- 5

# ifelse()
ifelse(test = a == 4, 
       yes  = a^2, 
       no   = a)
```

### `for` loops

*Basic structure:*

```{webr-r}
# for(loopindex in loopvector){
#    do any code in here
# }
```

**Example 1**

A loop that prints the index of the current loop.

```{webr-r}
for(iter_i in 1:10){
  cat("The current loop index is", iter_i, "\n")
}
```

**NOTE**: as a practice, use names for your loop index that ends with `_i`, for example, `iter_i`, `year_i`, and `ind_i`; this will allow you to differentiate between the loop index and your other objects.

**Example 2**

Let's create a matrix whose elements are equal to the multiplication of the row and column numbers (i.e., let $m_{i,j}$ be the element in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of the matrix, then $m_{i,j} = i\times j$).

```{webr-r}
# Create an empty matrix with four rows and two columns
m_A <- matrix(data = NA,
              nrow = 4,
              ncol = 2)

# Fill out the matrix by multiplying the i-th row and j-th column.
# Nested for loops.
for(row_i in 1:nrow(m_A)){
  for(col_i in 1:ncol(m_A)){
    m_A[row_i,col_i] <- row_i*col_i
  }
}
m_A
```

### `while` loops

When you do not know how often the desired operations should be executed, you can use the `while` loop.

*Basic structure:*

```{webr-r}
# while(loopcondition){
#    do any code in here
# }
```

**Example 1**

Let's create a code that calculates the factorial of any number.

```{webr-r}
# Get the factorial of any number
# Number
a <- 6

# Factorial value
factorial_value <- 1

# While loop
while(a >= 0){
  if(a != 0){
    factorial_value <- factorial_value*a
  }
  a <- a - 1
}

# Get factorial
factorial_value
```

## Writing functions

*Basic structure:*

```{webr-r}
# functionname <- function(arg1,arg2,arg3,...){
#    do any code in here when called
#    return(returnobject)
# }
```

**Example 1**

A function that simply assigns three different objects.

```{webr-r}
# Function that assigns three objects
dummy1 <- function(){
  aa <- 2.5
  bb <- "string"
  dd <- 4:8
}

# Execute function
dummy1()

# Get aa value
aa
```

Note that even if you run the function, trying to get the element `aa` does not work. This happens because everything that is executed inside a function resides locally in the function. To get the objects you create inside a function, you need to add a `return()`.

However, what happens if you run `bn <- dummy1()` and then get the object `bn`?

```{webr-r}
# Function that assigns three objects
dummy1 <- function(){
  aa <- 2.5
  bb <- "string"
  dd <- 4:8
}

# Execute the function and assign it to an object
bn <- dummy1()

# Get bn value
bn
```

Note that a function that does not have a `return()` technically returns nothing; but it implicitly returns the last line of code.

**Example 2**

But how many `return()` can a function have? See the following example of a function with multiple returns.

```{webr-r}
# Function with two return()
dummy2 <- function(){
  aa <- 2.5
  bb <- "string1"
  return(aa)
  dd <- 4:8
  return(bb)
}

# Execute function
dummy2()
```

Note that a function can have multiple `return()`, however, once it encounters one, it exits.

**Example 3**

A function with arguments.

```{webr-r}
# Get the sum of two numbers
# if a and b are numbers then return the sum
# otherwise, return NA
get_sum <- function(a,b){
  if(is.numeric(a) & is.numeric(b)){
    return(a+b)
  }
  else{
    return(NA)
  }
}

# Execute function
get_sum(4,5)
get_sum("a",5)
```

Does a function always require arguments? No, it doesn't. A list of arguments is not always required to execute a function. So, when is it necessary to add arguments to our functions? We add them when we want to execute a code multiple times using different input values.

**Ellipsis `...`**

It allows you to pass additional arguments without having to first define them in the argument list, and these arguments can then be passed to another function call within the body of the code.

```{webr-r}
# Create a function that plots x values 
# against y values with some flexibility in 
# passing other arguments to plot() using ellipses
myplot_fun <- function(x,y,...){
  
  # Creates an error if x length and y length are not equal
  if(length(x) != length(y)){
    message("Error: vectors must be the same length")
  }
  else{
    # If the lengths x and y are equal, graph them 
    # and add more arguments using ...
    plot(x,y,...)
  }
}

# Run the function with x and y
myplot_fun(x = c(1,2,3,4), 
           y = c(5,6,7,8))

# Run the function with x and y with
# different dimensions
myplot_fun(x = c(1,2,3,4),
           y = c(5,6,7))

# Run the function with other arguments
myplot_fun(x = c(1,2,3,4), 
           y = c(5,6,7,8),
           main = "Plot in a function", 
           col  = "red",                
           xlab = "x-axis",            
           ylab = "y-axis")
```

# Applications

## Markov models

This section is based on @drabo2023 and follows the same example of hepatitis B. The coding sections have been created by me.

### Introduction

-   Models can be a valuable tool for public health decision-making. They help to extrapolate the long-term effects of observed clinical trials and estimate the distribution of a population into different health states when implementing policy strategies.

-   Health (e.g., life years, quality of life years) and economic (e.g., vaccination costs) outcomes can be estimated for each strategy considered.

-   Markov models represent how individuals in a cohort move between health states based on their probabilities of previous states.

-   *Markov assumption*: all states are independent of all past states.

### Elements

1.  Set of health states that are mutually *exclusive* (an individual cannot be in both states simultaneously) and *exhaustive* (includes all possible states).

2.  Transition matrix that represents the transition of individuals in a cohort between different health states (constant or time-varying).

$$
T = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
q(s_1,s_1) & q(s_1,s_2) & q(s_1,s_3) \\
q(s_2,s_1) & q(s_2,s_2) & q(s_2,s_3)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

-   $q(s_i,s_j)$ describes the transition probability from the current state $s_i$ to the transition state $s_j$.

-   The value of each transition probability ranges between 0 and 1.

-   Each row must sum to 1 since all states are mutually exclusive.

3.  Transitions occur over a period, called cycle $t$.
4.  The probability of being in a state $S(t)$ can be denoted as:

$$
S(t) = S(0)\times T^t
$$

where, $S(0)$ is the vector of the probabilities of being in each state at the beginning of the simulation, $T^t$ is the product of multiplying $t$ state transition matrices.

5.  Set of rewards or payoffs (e.g., cost of benefits) associated to each state.
6.  If an individual is unable to leave a state once they enter it (e.g., dead), that state is considered to be an *absorbing* state, and any non-absorbing state is called *transient*.

### Example: hepatitis B vaccine

-   Five mutually exclusive health states: susceptible (**S**), infected (**I**), vaccinated (**V**), recovered (**R**), and dead (**D**).

![State transition diagram](fig_SIVRD_model.png){fig-align="center" width="15cm"}

-   Cycle length 1 year.
-   Time horizon 59 years.
-   Model inputs usually come from published data, clinical trials (e.g., vaccine efficacy), transition probabilities from life tables, expert panels, among others.
    -   The proportion of susceptible people getting vaccinated each cycle is 0.10.
    -   70% of susceptible people become infected each year.
    -   0.0045% of the vaccinated individuals lose protection from the vaccine.
    -   7 out of 8 people with hepatitis B recover.
    -   The probability of death is 0.002 for susceptible, vaccinated, and recovered individuals, and 0.006 for infected individuals.
    -   Susceptible cohort population.

#### Steps into developing a model in `R`

1.  **Parameterization of the model.**

    We will create a function that takes the model inputs as arguments and returns a list containing all the model parameters.

```{webr-r}
# List of model parameters
#
# n_t: time horizon
# cycle_len: cycle length
# v_state_init: vector of initial health states
# 
# Transition probabilities 
#   p_S_V: from susceptible to vaccinated
#   p_S_I: from susceptible to infected
#   p_S_D: from susceptible to dead
#   p_V_I: from vaccinated to infected
#   p_V_D: from vaccinated to dead
#   p_I_R: from infected to recovered
#   p_I_D: from infected to dead
#   p_R_D: from recovered to dead

load_params_all <- function(n_t, 
                            cycle_len,
                            v_state_init,
                            p_S_V,
                            p_S_I,
                            p_S_D,
                            p_V_I,
                            p_V_D,
                            p_I_R,
                            p_I_D,
                            p_R_D){
  
    # Health states
    v_state_names <- names(v_state_init)
    
    # Number of health states
    n_states <- length(v_state_names)

    n_cycles <- n_t/cycle_len 
    v_times  <- seq(0, n_cycles, by = 1)
  
    # Transition matrix
    m_T <- matrix(data     = 0,
                  nrow     = n_states,
                  ncol     = n_states,

    return(l_params_all)
  }
```

2.  **Markov model function**.

    Now that we have a function that collects all the model inputs into a list, let's create a function that takes the model parameters and returns the distribution of health states at each step.

```{webr-r}
# Function that takes the model parameters
# and returns the distribution of health states
run_Markov <- function(l_params){
  
    # Get all the parameters from the list
    n_t           <- l_params$n_t          
    cycle_len     <- l_params$cycle_len
    n_cycles      <- l_params$n_cycles
    v_times       <- l_params$v_times
    v_state_names <- l_params$v_state_names
    n_states      <- l_params$n_states
    v_state_init  <- l_params$v_state_init
    m_T           <- l_params$m_T
    
    # Create an array containing the transition 
    # probability matrices for each time step. 
    # Each "slice" of the array contains the
    # transition between states.
    a_m_T <- array(NA, dim = c(n_states,n_states,n_cycles))
    for(time_i in v_times){ # time_i = 1
      a_m_T[ , , time_i] <- m_T
    }
    
    # Create the transition trace matrix (m_TR)  
    # capturing the proportion of the cohort in 
    # each state at each time point
    m_TR <-  matrix(
      data     = 0, 
      nrow     = n_cycles + 1, 
      ncol     = n_states, 
      dimnames = list(
        # row names
        paste("cycle", 0:n_cycles, sep = ""), 
        # col names
        v_state_names
        )
      )
    
    # Indicate the initial health state
    m_TR[1, ]  <- v_state_init
    
    # Run the simulation 
    for (time_i in 2:(n_cycles + 1)){ # i = 2
      
      # Calculate the proportion of the cohort 
      # in each state at time t
      m_TR[time_i, ] <- t(m_TR[time_i - 1, ]) %*% a_m_T[ , , time_i-1]
      
    } 
    
    # Return the trace matrix
    return(m_TR)
  
}
```

3.  **Simulation**:

    We run the Markov model with the specific model inputs.

```{webr-r}
# Time horizon
n_t <- 59             # lifetime horizon
cycle_len <- 1        # 1 year

# Initial state
v_state_init <- c(S = 1, 
                  V = 0, 
                  I = 0, 
                  R = 0, 
                  D = 0)  

# Transition probabilities
p_S_V <- 0.1
p_S_I <- 0.7
p_S_D <- 0.002
p_V_I <- 0.0045/100
p_V_D <- 0.002
p_I_R <- 7/8
p_I_D <- 0.006
p_R_D <- 0.002

# Load list of parameters
l_params_all <- load_params_all(n_t          = n_t, 
                                cycle_len    = cycle_len,
                                v_state_init = v_state_init,
                                p_S_V        = p_S_V,
                                p_S_I        = p_S_I,
                                p_S_D        = p_S_D,
                                p_V_I        = p_V_I,
                                p_V_D        = p_V_D,
                                p_I_R        = p_I_R,
                                p_I_D        = p_I_D,
                                p_R_D        = p_R_D)

# Run the Markov model
m_trace <- run_Markov(l_params = l_params_all)
```

4.  **Plot health states**

```{webr-r}
# Create data.frame with results
df_trace <- rbind(
  data.frame(time  = l_params_all$v_times,
             var   = "Susceptible",
             value = as.numeric(m_trace[,"S"])),
  data.frame(time  = l_params_all$v_times,
             var   = "Vaccinated",
             value = as.numeric(m_trace[,"V"])),
  data.frame(time  = l_params_all$v_times,
             var   = "Infected",
             value = as.numeric(m_trace[,"I"])),
  data.frame(time  = l_params_all$v_times,
             var   = "Recovered",
             value = as.numeric(m_trace[,"R"])),
  data.frame(time  = l_params_all$v_times,
             var   = "Dead",
             value = as.numeric(m_trace[,"D"]))
  )

# Plot results
plot(x = df_trace$time[df_trace$var == "Susceptible"],
     y = df_trace$value[df_trace$var == "Susceptible"],
     col = "forestgreen",
     type = "l", 
     xlab = "Time", 
     ylab = "Prop. of people",
     xlim = c(0,20))
lines(x = df_trace$time[df_trace$var == "Vaccinated"],
     y = df_trace$value[df_trace$var == "Vaccinated"],
     col = "purple")

     col = "red")

     y = df_trace$value[df_trace$var == "Recovered"],
     col = "steelblue")
lines(x = df_trace$time[df_trace$var == "Dead"],
     y = df_trace$value[df_trace$var == "Dead"],
     col = "black")
title("Hepatitis B cohort distribution")
